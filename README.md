# ü•û Pancake App

A portfolio website built as the final project for the JavaScript course at Business College Helsinki. The goal was to showcase practical skills in JavaScript development. The app includes two pages: an Order Menu and an Order Management page. On the Order Menu page users can customize and add orders which are then saved to localStorage. On the Order Management page users can view, update and delete existing orders. All changes are saved to localStorage. The management page also supports searching orders by ID and sorting them by status.
