## Clearly explain key learnings from the course
Throughout this JavaScript course, I’ve learned a lot. I’ve discovered that you can do so many different things with JavaScript and achieve the same result in many different ways. For me, it was really interesting seeing how the pancake menu assignment can be done in two different ways.

We started with data types, operators, and variables. At this point, everything seemed clear and fairly simple, and I was excited to learn new things. The most difficult parts weren’t the coding itself, but using GitHub and trying to write quickly in class so I wouldn’t fall behind. I also made a decision that this period, I would focus most on JavaScript (because of the time limit), as HTML and CSS are something I will have an easier time focusing on during the summer while working.

When we got to functions, it really felt tough in the beginning, and I remember thinking with some assignments, "I’ll never get this," especially the calculator ones. But now, looking back, they seem so simple. Numbers, strings, loops, and conditions also felt more difficult at first. With my small experience in Python, these were things I had some prior knowledge of so I had an idea of what to expect, and I’d say knowing a bit of Python really helped. The number of brackets and parentheses in JavaScript really threw me off and I spent a lot of time fixing my code. During this time I also realized there are many ways to write code that achieves the same thing. I also discovered that I really enjoy if-statements although I don’t know why.

When we got into the DOM, it really felt like "Now we’re programming." It was more challenging especially with projects like the Pancake Maker and ATM simulator but I enjoyed it. The code was longer, it did more things, and there were more characters to look after. I think at this point, I realized that studying 30 minutes a day after school wouldn’t be enough as we went further into the course. While working with the DOM, I felt like I was building something real. It was also the first time I got slighly frustrated not getting something to work and had to spend long hours on one assignment. This was when my Python knowledge stopped being as helpful.

Objects were where things got tricky. There were so many assignments and they took a long time to complete. I learned how to find better resources because Google often led me to very complex code. I started using YouTube a lot. On YouTube the code was often more understandable and the videos explained the code, which was very useful. I also realized that with so many assignments I didn’t have enough time to learn everything I wanted about objects. I started writing down things I would learn during the summer. Objects gave me that “now we are coding” feeling and even though I was in a hurry I was happy because it felt like I was getting closer to my dream.

Arrays, localStorage, and JSON were interesting and felt easier than objects and the DOM. Though I had some difficulties with them the basics felt easier, which was a nice break after some of the more complicated parts. It made me realize that once you push through more difficult stuff the stuff you found earlier to be difficul suddently feels easy - like functions. In the final weeks, we worked with error handling, fault finding, JavaScript writing practices, async, chaining, destructuring, and the rest operator. I still don’t feel like I’ve fully grasped these topics because there’s been so much to do and so little time. I want to go through them again during the summer.

Overall, this course really improved my JavaScript skills and I’m excited to continue learning more! I really love JavaScript even when it's difficult. The most difficult part of this course was definitely time. I was able to handle time management well, but even with that you don’t have enough time to research and do things as well as you’d like. I’ve explained to a lot of my close ones how the problem is not motivation—it's that there aren't enough hours in the day to do everything as well as I want. Another thing I want to work on is the ‘no balconies’—I feel that I haven’t yet had enough time to fully understand my code.

## Strengths:

- My current lifestyle allows me to study after school.
- Motivation to study after school, appreciating the opportunity and taking things seriously.
- Difficult tasks and problem-solving drive me to work harder, which especially helped with the Pancake project.
- Understanding that time I limited and planning own workd regarding that - Time management.
- I work hard for my goals - nothing comes free
- I find motivation from deadlines and they help me to push further.
- I am really passionate about programming and I enjoy doing it on my free time


## Improvements:
- I need to learn more JavaScript and learn to better understand the code so that there won't be any balconies.
- I need to redo my tasks for better understanding.
- I especially wanna learn API because I found API weather website assigments very difficult. 
- My code is often ugly: forget to use prettier, forget to use semicolon, mix " and ' in same code. 
- I often copy my older code which has lead to me struggling to write code without mistakes without copying it. 
- Brackets give me a headdache. 
- Finding better ways to concentrate on class so I wouldn't have to spend so much time learning the topics at home. 
- Name things better. 
- My desptop is a mess. file names aren’t standardized and I forget to add .gitignore.
- I need to push more often my code to github. Not only when I stop working.

## Before: 
Level 0.1: 
Before the course, I spent a few hours watching YouTube videos about JavaScript, but most of those topics were already covered in the first week. So it gave me a good start but didn’t help much further. Python helped a bit. 

## After: 
Level 2: 
Every time I learn something new, I realize there’s much more to learn. Right now I feel like I have a solid foundation for learning more Javascript, so I would rate myself at Level 1.5.

# Two challenges from this course:

## API Weather App: 
When I first started building the API weather app, I tried to Google for solutions. I found a site with very complex code and assumed that APIs were incredibly difficult. For four hours, I tried to make the code work, but I had no idea what most parts of it was doing. I realized later that I should have taken a step back and watched a YouTube tutorial instead of blindly trying to fix it. I learned that it’s okay to research and break down problems into smaller steps. Not only that but also to understand your limitations as a beginner.

## It’s Not Always the JavaScript: 
During the course, there were many times when my code wouldn’t work. I’d keep trying and trying, but nothing happened. A lot of times, it was something small like having the wrong name in the HTML or not having an internet connection. Once, it was a problem with local storage, and it took me four hours to figure it out. I learned to take a breath and assess the situation before diving into changes. It might not be a coding problem so don't assume it. 

## Curly Brackets: From the start, I've had severe issues with curly brackets. It took a lot of work to learn where they go. I now understand that getting them right from the start is important to save time later and while I still struggle, I’m getting better.

## Pancake Project

# urpose of the Pancake Project:
- Learn more about JavaScript. 
- Learn more about DOM manipulation.
- Learn how to deploy a site on Vercel.
- Work with a longer code.
- Put what we have learned to use
- Learn how to find information

# Purpose of the site:
Pancake Menu lets you view all order options and place an order. The user must enter a name to proceed with the order; if not, an alert appears. After selecting items the user can view a summary by clicking “See Order” and then place the order by clicking order button. Price banner makes sure you know the total price all the time. After pressing orders button all orders get saved to localStorage. Each order is assigned a random ID after pressing order button. 

# Pancake Order Management: 
All orders are displayed in one place for easier management. Users can delete orders only if the status is "delivered." Orders can also have their status changed (with a refresh required to update). Users can sort orders by status and search by ID. The "Menu" button takes the user back to the menu. Use 'Menu' or 'Order mangement' button to change sites. 


## Highlighting What Worked Well and What I'm Proud Of:

This project made me realize how much I’ve learned. I had to researcha a lot to be able to finihs the whole pancake assigment, but at the same time I was able to solve lot of problems and write code by myself without the help. Example I made delete button that all order get. I wanted to make sure it only works for orders with status 'delivered' and was able to come up that I wans use && to make sure the code won't run for other statukses. Using querySelector and addEventListener started to feel more easy at this point and I felt fairly confidents with them. I also spent a lot of time just trying different things and seeing if they work. There were mutiple moments where I know I was very close but it didn't just work yet. I'm also proud I was able to complete it on time, because that was not an easy task. It took me days and hours. What helped with the assigment a lot was the steps. It's something I'm gonna do in the future: before you start working but eveyrthing to steps.

 I had trouble fetching data from localStorage. After hours the problem was solved by changing the key everywhere. Similarly I spent log time trying to figure out why orders aren't coming trough before realizing all new orders don't appear first. They appear last. I also found it difficult to know where all parts of code should go. What should be before what? For me finding the solutions was about trying and fail and error. I have the tehdency to name things in a very similar way so that I myself have difficulties knowing what is what. Like I've mentiones I made clear decisons on what to focus on the most. I found it difficult to find time for CSS when I had so much Javascript to do.  I also often pushed to GitHub only at the end of my workday and used Command + Z a lot. I lost some code in the process. The most important thing for the future I would says is: Make the code more understandable. No balconies. Find multiple ways to do the same thing and see what makes most sense to you.
